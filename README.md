# SymbolicRegresssionUsingGeneticAlgo

This project runs a regression to find the fittest line for a given set of finite points. It does this by creating a generation of algebraic trees at random and then uses genetic programming as a search heuristic to create newer and fitter generations. Currently it uses 1 independent variable and 4 binary operators (+,-,/,*) but is easily scalable for more elaborate inputs.
